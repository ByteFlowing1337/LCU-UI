## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10 or higher**
- **League of Legends Client** (for LCU API access)
- **uv** (recommended) or pip for package management

### Installation with uv (Recommended)

```powershell
# Install uv if you haven't already
# Visit: https://github.com/astral-sh/uv

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ByteFlowing1337/LCU-UI.git
cd LCU-UI

# Install dependencies
uv sync

# Run the application
uv run src/main.py
```

### Installation with pip

```powershell
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ByteFlowing1337/LCU-UI.git
cd LCU-UI

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# Install dependencies
pip install -e .

# Run the application
python src/main.py
```

---

## 📖 Usage

### Starting the Server

```powershell
# With uv
uv run python src/main.py

# Or with Python directly
python src/main.py
```

The server will automatically:

1. Detect your local IP address
2. Start on `http://0.0.0.0:5000`
3. Open your default browser to the interface

### Web Interface

Once running, navigate to the displayed URL (typically `http://localhost:5000`) to access:

- **Home Page**: Quick navigation to all features
- **Summoner Search**: Look up player profiles and match history
- **Live Game**: Monitor ongoing matches
- **Settings**: Enable/disable auto-accept and other features

### LCU Connection

The application automatically detects the League Client and establishes a connection when:

- League of Legends client is running
- You are logged into an account
- LCU API is accessible

Connection status is displayed in the web interface.
